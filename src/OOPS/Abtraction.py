# Abstrction = Hiding implementation details of the class and only showing essential features to the user of object

# It helps in focusing on "What" an object does, rather than "How" it does it.

#In Python, abstraction is mainly achieved using:

# Abstract Classes
#
# Abstract Methods
#
# We implement them using the abc module (abc = Abstract Base Class).
#
# ðŸ”¹ Abstract Class
#
# An abstract class:
#
# Cannot be instantiated directly.
#
# Can contain abstract methods (methods declared but not implemented).
#
# Can also contain normal methods.
#
# ðŸ‘‰ To define abstract methods, we use the @abstractmethod decorator.
